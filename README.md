This was funny. I just not only code but also do lots of problem solving. 
Well! I also do learn new visualization tools and technologies in the market. I also write article that relates trouble and situations I faced while trying to become a Developer. I focus more on writing about self-motivation, positivity, self-confidence. One of my favorite hobbies is to Code, write, Solve Problems, create new problems.
